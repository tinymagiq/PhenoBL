# PhenoBL (Phenomenon Based Learning)

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Phenomenon Based Learning. The Phenomenon Based Learning model or PhenoBL has been pioneered by Finnish Educators since 2016-17. PhenoBL is very effective at mindset change compared to the typically used topic-based learning model. PhenoBL is a paradigm shift (in the Thomas Kuhn sense of the phrase) that is just getting started. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift"> Click for More details on Paradigm Shift </a>
 
We at <a href="https://tinymagiq.com"> Tiny Magiq </a> are happy to say that the framework we have developed over the last 5+ years -  HiPoHa for Digital Transformation , is based on the principles of PhenoBL. We have gotten here through a series of lucky accidents to present to you what may be amongst the world's first few commercial/corporate implementations of PhenoBL. 

## What is PhenoBL & Why PhenoBL? 
To understand PhenoBL, we can use the example of a tsunami. For us to learn about tsunamis we only need to learn the relevant parts from the topic areas: geology, seismology, plate tectonics, metrology, climatology, geography, history of tsunamis in a particular area, disaster management, physics of tidal waves & ocean currents etc. 

In a typical topic-based learning model, we might have learnt all of the individual topic areas mentioned above at-length but may not learn about tsunamis in detail at all because it is a phenomenon that cuts across all these topic areas. 

To give another example to reinforce the point, the Covid 19 global crisis that we are all experiencing now is a phenomenon of pandemics. We have to understand many topic areas to understand pandemics. 

Given that the world that we live in is a world of phenomena not topics, PhenoBL is the best approach to take to deal with the VUCA world we are operating in.

## Bringing PhenoBL to life in corporates/commercial enterprises 

In PhenoBL, a program needs an anchor phenomenon. For example, the anchor phenomenon of Tsunami acts as the holding thread across all the learnings, concepts from the various topic areas to understand Tsunamis. Learning is the primary outcome in the grade school education setup where PhenoBL is being pioneered by Finnish educators. Additionally, in the grade school setup at best students can create experiments of phenomena to learn more effectively. 

We in Tiny Magiq have extended PhenoBL to help employees of our clients <b> make the phenomenon of digital transformation </b> happen and not just <b> learn about Digital Transformation </b>. Digital Transformation being the phenomenon we go after. 

Towards we have extended the concept of Anchor Phenomenon to what we call Measurable Anchor Phenomenon (MAP). We work with our client stakeholders to determine a MAP that our program participants (our mentees) can achieve during the 120 day program.  The MAPs will serve as the anchor phenomena to make happen.  

The MAPs can’t be achieved without developing the required skills and mindsets in Adaptable Leadership. In other words, the achievement of the MAP would serve as the evidence of skills gained & mindsets changed and be one of the key success criteria for measuring the program’s effectiveness.  

For example, a MAP could be – How many employees of the client organization adopted a particular digital trasnformation championed by participant in our program? If we start measuring and tracking that, we can easily convert that into a $ benefit. For example, if an innovation adopted by 20% of employees resulted in 1 hour of productivity gains for each of them, we can easily convert that into a $ benefit. We can also make the $ benefit as a MAP if we choose to. 

To give another example, let us look at measuring the effectiveness of a field marketing department. In a typical topic-based model, a field marketing department may be measured just on the number of leads they generate which doesn’t yield good results over time. Whereas in Tiny Magiq's PhenoBL, the MAP will be the number of leads they generate that have been <b> converted into a sale </b>.  The last few words in bold make it a phenomenon and will automatically drive collaboration between field marketing, sales, delivery, quality assurance and other stakeholder groups that get involved in converting a lead into a sale. 

We think this makes Tiny Magiq's implementation of PhenoBL dramatically more effective and more innovative too.
